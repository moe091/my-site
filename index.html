  	TODO:
  	
  	plans...
  		Turn the 'services' section into an interactive demo showing off pieces of different things I can do. e.g clips/screenshots of Merkle Brown, NuTrack, and portfolio page itself(webpage-inception/recursion):
  		- dark/black background, with a barely lit(gradient from dark-grey to black) floor section at the bottom extending up and to the middle(angled to look like a floor).
  		- full-screen(100vh)
  		- Across the top is a row with 3-4 blocks(web apps, static sites, games, get in touch). whichever one is selected slides to the end/right, 'rotating' the whole row(any blocks to the right will rotate off the side and come back on the left). ends of the row have a gradient from transparent-to-black, so that before a block slides off the end it looks like it's fading out as it moves further to the right, or fading in as it moves in from the left. Maybe mess around with squeezing/stretching the width as it goes off one of the ends too(if x > threshold then width = maxWidth * (x - threshhold) * modifier / 100)
  		- whichever item is current being displayed is shown below the row, taking up most of the screen. There is large text to the left going from top to bottom of screen, with a big picture/gif/video to the right taking up most of the right side of screen. Title is above the text on the left, not above the whole thing.
  		
  		
  		PORTFOLIO...
  		Also full-screen, but this time white/light colored:
  		
  				-!!!!!!!!!!Make it so that the portfolio section looks like a block/box, and the services section is an empty space/cube. The 'floor' part of the services section can be made to look like the top of the 'portfolio' section block.
  		
  		- 3x3 large squares for each project. Each square is an image, tinted a different color(red, purple, blue, pink, orange, yellow) with white text over it for the name and maybe some details/description. Hovering over the square gets rid of the tint, and makes the square grow a little bit(without effecting positioning of other blocks. for every px the width/height grows, decrease the margins of the square or the padding of it's container by the same amount)
  		
  		- when a square/project is clicked, all the project squares fade out, and then a full-screen div fades in from top to bottom(render the full-screen div and another full-screen white div covering it, the white div has a small gradient to transparent at the top. white div slides down and off the bottom or shrinks to 0 height, giving the appearance of the project-div fading in from top to bottom).
  		
  		- project details div(and the project section in general) should be very open and spacey. Is very white(with maybe some slight grey gradient in the middle), with big paddings/margins around all the text and images. Make it feel free and open and calm, instead of congested and cluttered and hectic.
  		
  		
  		
  		Create an image for skills section, listing all languages/tech in a tree-like structure. Put that in the right col and put a short bio on the left
  		
  		
  		Urgent To-Do's - before anyone looks at my portfolio:
  		PORTFOLIO:
  			- Do some algorithm writeups w/ solutions and post as a portfolio item to demonstrate competence/skill in algorithms/data-structures. Start with a Dijkstra or a difficult BFS/DFS, include some simple but tricky "riddle-y" problems, one or two DP problems, and anything else that is interesting or fun
  		NUTRACK:
  			- For each page that requires user to be logged in to user, add a "You must be logged in to access this page" warning, and below it give instructions such as "If you are viewing this site from my portfolio, log in(link in top nav bar) with username: nutrack password: nupass. Also create meals and fill up Tracker/Planner on the example account so users can easily view the web apps functionality

						 	I am a full-stack web developer, meaning I can create a back end that connects to a database, manipulates data, and sends data to the frontend - and I can also do complex front end development, create complex UI's, make a web page adapt to different screen sizes and communicate with the back end to grab data and display it in a clear and appealing way. I've created many web applications from scratch and am experienced at creating complex web apps with clean, well-organized code.

						  I also love to create fun and interactive content for websites. That includes anything from real-time data visualization to a complete, fully-featured game that you can play on a website without downloading anything(even on mobile phones!). Combined with my back end / front end web development skills, I can create some truly unique and impressive web experiences. Check out this video of my current HTML5 game project <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKEsksspLBQ"> "Merkle Brown" </a> for an example of what web browser based games are capable of

            	As stated in the sectio to the left(or above if you're on a small screen), I consider myself a creator. Programming is just the tool that I use, and I personally thing I'm pretty darn good at using it, but I also bring a lot of other very useful skills to the table. I have experience with the full development cycle for websites/web apps, mobile apps, and games. This means that I can turn that web app idea you've been wanting to make into a quality website, I can ask you some questions about your business and use that information to create the perfect website to increase your sales, I can help turn your game concept into a full-fledged design and the program it for you, I can take a set of business requirements or specifications and write clean, robust, and error-free code that does exactly what it's supposed to. Right now I am searching for employment as a web or software developer and am also open to accepting freelance jobs, so <a href="#">contact me</a> if you need to hire a creator who happens to be good at writing code

								Here are a few different ways I can use my skills to create awesome software for you! These are just a few of the most common applications of my skillset, I have experience creating many other types of software - and even if I don't have experience with something I'm always up for learning new things and am capable of picking up new technologies and skills on the fly if the job calls for it.

            		<p class="project-text tldr">Merkle Brown includes both a game and an integrated level-editor. I'm extremely proud of the game itself, and by the time it's all done and polished, with awesome graphics and a complete set of well-designed levels, I think it will be a genuinely fun and unique game with a decent shot at modest commercial success. Although I'm most proud of the game, the level editor I've created is honestly the real 'technical' acheivement of this project; it allows me to design and test levels within the editor, and is capable of implementing a huge range of features and physical objects that can be combined to do almost anything. Merkle Brown has been on the backburner while I worked on NuTrack, but I'm getting ready to dive back in and am very excited. I've learned a lot in the meantime and the first thing I will do is refactor and clean up the code. I have a few more big features and a bunch of little ones left to implement, although the vast majority of the engine and editor are completed. Once I'm done finishing off the last of the features, all that will be left to do before releasing the demo is to create a full set of high-quality graphics and some well-designed and interesting levels(both of which may sound easy enough, but I know it will be a TON of work).</p>
            		
								<p class="project-text tldr">I'm already starting to build up a following for the game on twitter, come <a href="https://twitter.com/indiegamemo">follow me</a> for updates or a chance to play the demo when it's ready!</p>
            		
            		<h5 class="project-subheader text-left">Overview</h5>
            		<p class="project-text">Merkle Brown is my current 'secondary' side-project, that I work on when I need a break from my main project. I plan on releasing it on several platforms as a commercial indie game when it's complete, using different wrappers to deploy it on Steam/Windows, Android, iOS, and of course I'll release it as a browser-based html5 game as well - it will even run in mobile web browsers without any downloads or plugins</p>
            		
                    <h5 class="project-subheader text-left">Features</h5>
            		<p class="project-text">Merkle Brown is a 2D, physics-based platformer game with realtime physics simulation, custom hardware-accelerated shaders for lighting and other effects, tons of complicated dynamic and scripted game objects, and an extremely capable(albeit ugly) level editor that allows you to build dynamic obstacles by combining different bodies, triggers, effects, actions, movepaths, joints, springs, and more, allowing endless possibilities for different creative and fun game objects. It's also possible playtest levels as you create them inside the editor, allowing for quick iteration and testing - which is crucial when designing non-tile based levels for a platformer game and you need to position things just right in order to perfect the difficulty curve.</p>
                  
                  
                    <h5 class="project-subheader text-left">Progress</h5>
                    <p class="project-text">Although the engine itself is mostly complete and editor and other game code is pretty far along, none of the levels or graphics I have created at this point will end up in the final game. I've written all the tools I need to create an awesome and fun game, and now I just need to put it all together into a cohesive whole using quality assets and exceptional level & graphic design. My art skills were HORRIBLE when I started this project, and although they've come a very long way, I don't think I'm capable of doing the game justice with my art yet. I'm much better with level design, and have made some truly interesting and enjoyable levels already while building and testing the different features of my engine and editor, but I really want to focus on getting the level design absolutely perfect as I feel that is the single most crucial factor in making a quality platformer game, and I'm not quite there yet. I plan on continuing to do what I've done this far, which is to keep iterating on the graphics and level design as a add features and improve my engine and editor, pushing myself to learn more and improve a lot on each iteration, until I finally feel like I'm capable of creating a truly top-quality game that stands out in every category. I've come such a long way from when I first started, and this project has truly been an emotional journey, but I know if I keep improving as I have been and stay true to my vision I will end up with an amazing game that I can be extremely proud of</p>

            			NuTrack is a web application made with Node, MongoDB, React, and Express, among other technologies. It also has tests(still incomplete) written with Enzyme, Chai, and JSDom to ensure it works as intended in all scenarios, CSS3 styles compiled with SASS, Bootstrap to simplify the process of making responsive layouts, and many other libraries(but not too many, at least compared to most modern javascript projects!) to provide additional functionalities. 
            		</p>
            		<p class="project-text tldr">
            			My original goal with this web app was to learn some new libraries to add to my existing javascript/web dev skills, but it quickly turned into a much larger and more serious project. I started using the app myself to track my calorie intake and make sure I was eating enough, and I really enjoyed how it tracked other nutrients and vitamins automatically, which actually prompted me to become more aware of my diet and improve my eating habits. I became much more concerned with the features and usability of the app after I started using myself, and started adding features and improving the UI to turn it into something closer to a commercial web application. I still have a lot of planned features that I'm actively working on implementing and have a long way to go, but I'm pretty proud of how advanced and useable NuTrack has become already
            		</p>
            		<p class="project-text tldr">
            			Right now, NuTrack users can search the USDA Nutrient Database, get nutrition information for any product/item, create and save meals/recipes by combining multiple items and choosing an amount or # of servings for each one, view Nutrient Tables for saved meals or individual items, Add any items or meals to their Tracker or Planner, setting the date, time, and amount, view the items and meals they've eaten over any time period they choose via the Tracker and see their nutrient totals over that time period, and do the same thing with the Planner to view their nutrition plan over any time period. There are many other smaller features, and many more on NuTracks to-do list, but that's the gist of the app. I have many more features I plan on implementing soon, the one I am most excited about is OCR(optical character recognition) - to allow users to snap a photo of an items nutrition facts label and have the site automatically process it and extrac the text to gather the nutrient information and add the item to the sites nutrient database(for items not in the USDA database). I hope that once I get through my to-do list, NuTrack will be ready to be released as a commercial web-app that helps many users become more aware of their eating habits and offer helpful insights to help them improve their diets.
            		</p>
            		
            		<h5 class="project-subheader text-left">Overview</h5>
            		<p class="project-text">NuTrack is a Single-Page Web Application made with Node, MongoDB, Express, and React. It retrieves nutrient data on the backend from the USDA Nutrient Data API and serves it with it's own custom API that adds many more features. The purpose of the app is to provide a flexible and easy-to-use tool that users can use to plan their food/nutrient consumption and track their progress. When I first started the project my plan was to make something with the USDA API mostly just to practice and learn some new technologies, but before long I ended up finding my own uses for the App and coming up with tons of useful new features that I wanted to add, and the project soon become something much larger and more useful than I had originally planned. I use it mainly to make sure I am getting enough calories to keep my weight up but it also provides other insights about my nutrition patterns automatically and has made me more aware of how my eating habits are effecting my health.</p>
            		
            		<p class="project-text">NuTrack is basically in the "Minimum-Viable-Product" phase right now, it works as a cohesive application and has many useful features, but the more I work on it the bigger my vision for the project becomes - I now have a pretty long todo-list of tweaks and new features I want to implement, some of which will improve the usability and capabilities of the app drastically. Once I implement a few of the larger, more impactful features that I have planned, I intend to set up real hosting for the app and release to the public as a commercial web app with trial accounts available for free and premium accounts available for a small monthly subscription fee. Right now I don't think NuTrack is useful enough for many people to want to pay for it; the limits of the USDA Database(mainly the lack of many popular food products) as well the lack of a few key features I plan on implementing and the mediocre, quickly made design of the current site are the only things holding it back from being a high-quality, useful, commercial web application. Luckily, all of these things are fixable - the limitations of the USDA Database will be the most difficult, but I have a fun and interesting solution planned to fix that problem.</p>
            		
            		<h5 class="project-subheader text-left">Goals / To-do List</h5>
            		<p class="project-text">
            			I have a lot of features in mind to improve NuTrack and make it into a commercial web app that people really want to use(even if I release it for free or use an ad-supported model). The feature I want to talk about first is using OCR(Optical Character Recognition - a technique to convert characters in images and other non-text formats into processable text using Machine Learning and other AI techniques) to allow users to quickly snap a picture of a products nutrition label in order to use the product within the app and add it into NuTracks Nutrition Database. The nutrition database is another feature I don't have implemented yet, currently relying on the USDA's great but somewhat incomplete nutrition facts database, but it will be added alongside OCR/user created products. although I've written a very basic handwriting-recognition script in Python in the past - and the nutrition label reader should be even simpler because typed text will be easier for a computer to interpret than handwriting - I plan on using a 3rd part OCR library(probably OCRAD) for this feature because I'm sure a large library maintained by experts in OCR will be more reliable than anything I could come up, especially since I don't want to spend a ton of time reinventing the wheel just for a single feature in one of my side-projects. I will, however, probably write some of my own pre-processing code to improve the usability and accuracy of the character recognition; things such as deskewing the image to normalize the photos taken by users and remove any tilt or angle from the nutrition label image, and stripping out any non-text lines or other artifacts that may interfere with the OCR libraries functions. Implementing these image pre-processing effects should be a fun but doable challenge that will help sharpen my skills and be a rewarding problem to solve, I also think that writing this code myself is practical for the end-result because I will be able to customize the code for the exact type of images that will be submitted to the optical characeter recognition algorithm - e.g. detecting the corners of the nutrition label in a photo will be much simpler when I know exactly what the corners look like for most labels, and once I have that figured out it will just take some relatively basic math to transform the image into a perfect, proportional rectangle that will be easy for the OCR algorithm to process.
            		</p>
            		
            		<p class="project-text">
            			I also plan on implementing some other features and changes that aren't quite as complicated, but will improve the usability and quality of Nutrack drastically. Redoing the entire layout is one of my main goals, the current layout was designed as I implemented features without much planning ahead of time. NuTrack was originally supposed to be a very small web app I made to learn some new technology so I wasn't worried about making it look great from the start. I did go back and do a little work to make it more presentable, but I think if I put my best effort into making NuTrack look great I could greatly improve the appearance and user-experience of the app.
            		</p>
            		
            		<p class="project-text">
            			I have atleast half a dozen more features already on my to-do list for NuTrack, and I don't have time to explain them all, but there is one more big feature that I really want to implement because I think it'd vastly improve the usefulness of the web app. I want to incorporate some statistics and data-visualization that allows users to view their nutrition intake patterns and trends over time, for example by generating different graphs and charts showing how their daily intake of, for example - calories, has changed over time. This will be easy to integrate with the already-existing data from the Tracker and Planner features, and can be implemented in a way that is highly customizeable; optimally I would like users to be able to select which nutrients to view data for, set goals to visually compare their nutrient intake against, set the time range that the chart covers and the start/end dates, view the information in a variety of different graph/chart types, and even create projections using the data from their Tracker, Planner, and transforming it with whatever proposed diet changes they want to visualize.

								<p class="project-text tldr">
									Let's Play is an Android app I created for a freelance client. My client had written a book about different card, dice, domino, and dart games containing rules, how to play, histories of the games, and other information, and he wanted an App to sell along with the book. He gave me the content of the book, formatted in html and css, and asked me to create an Android that displayed the books content organized inside of an easy-to-use UI and also contained a dynamic scoreboard that would work for any combination of game-type, number of players, and number of rounds. 
								</p>
								
								<p class="project-text tldr">
									The project actually consisted of several apps, mainly the '100 Games' version, but also separate versions for just cards, darts, dominos, or dice games. All of the apps were very similar to each other though and creating the different versions didn't add any new technical challenges to the project. In the section below you'll find links to the main '100 Games' app as well as the '25 Card Games' app on the app store.
								</p>
								<p class="project-text tldr">
									Instead of tediously copying every single page of the books content into Android Activities and layouts, I just created the basic UI flow and menu's and used a modified version of Android's WebView component to load the pages he gave me. The default WebView implementation took a second to load after the screen for that section of the book loaded, so I modified the code to pre-load the content for the pages to be displayed based on the users location in the menu so that when the user clicked on a game, the preloaded WebView could be displayed instantly. The preloading didn't have any noticeable performance side-effects and worked well across all Android devices tested.
								</p>

								<p class="project-text tldr">
									The project was completed successfully ahead of time, and I uploaded the App to the <a href="">App Store</a> for my client. He was very happy with the results and left me the following review on Elance.com:

								<p class="project-text project-tech text-center">
									<strong>Tech: </strong><br />
									Android, Java, AndEngine, Box2D, OpenGL
								</p>
								

								<p class="project-text tldr">
									Libra was one of my first real freelance projects. The client was an educator who already had a game app that they designed created by another freelancer. The app that they had was made with OpenGL, but didn't function reliably and was missing some key features they wanted, so they decided to find another developer to remake the game in AndEngine and fix the parts that were lacking in their previous app. AndEngine was a popular 2d Android game engine at the time that worked well with Box2D. 
								</p>

								<p class="project-text">
									This game was designed to teach fractions to young students. It consists of a balance scale and a bunch of small weights with a fraction drawn on them to denote how much they weight. At the beginning of a round, one side of the balance would have 1 or more weights on it and the other side would be empty. The player has a selection of different weights at the bottom of the screen and their goal is to drag and drop them on to the empty side of the scale to even out the weight. The game uses Box2D for real-time physics simulation, so the balance will tilt towards whichever side has more weight and even out as the user adds weights to the other side and gets closer to balancing the scale. The realistic physics and smooth feel helped students get an intuitive understanding of how fractions work and how the fractional weights relate to one another, I think the game really would help students comprehension of fractions.

								<p class="project-text">
									The original version of the app was created with openGL, and didn't have real physics simulation but instead was just programmed to either tilt the scale left or right depending which side had more weight until the user evened out both sides. In addition to providing the inuitive understanding of fractions, adding the physics also made the app function much more smoothly - e.g. instead of draging a weight to one side of the scale or the other and having it 'snap' into position on one of the scale plates, users could now drag it around the drop it and let it fall due to gravity and either land on the scale or fall to the ground, and users had to physically drop the weights on to the scale for it to work. If the user dropped the weight from a high height onto the scale it would make the scale quickly tip in the direction of the dropped weight before oscilating back and forth a few times and then balancing out - just as you'd expect the balance to behave in real life. The realistic feel made the game much more fun to play with in my opinion and probably helped engage students much more than the previous version of the app.
								</p>
								
								
								<p class="project-text">
									When I took the job I had almost no Android development experience, but it was a porting job from OpenGL to AndEngine, and I already knew a very small amount of OpenGL and had heard that AndEngine was easy to use and learn, so I decided to write a proposal for the job and hope the client hired me anyway. To my surprise I got hired and only had a couple weeks to complete the project - which in hindsight is a pretty long time for an App like this, but since I had to learn Android development and AndEngine first it was kind of a tight deadline for me. I finished the project with only a couple days to spare, and managed to fix all the bugs and missing features in the OpenGL version of the game(mostly just a bug to do with scoring and a problem with the touch & drag functionality not working sometimes) as well as add the realistic physics in and make the gameplay much smoother, which the client was very happy with. I received a 5-star review on Elance from the client with the following testimonial:

									This is just my personal site, which I suppose you already know about if you are reading this. I thought I'd share a little bit about designing and developing this site and my future plans for it though as it's probably one of my nicest-looking static websites I've created to date.
								</p>
								
								<p class="project-text tldr">
									I based the design of this site off of one of the Bootstrap examples but heavily modified it for my own needs. I wanted something simple and clean that presented the information I needed to share in a clear way, and I think this was the best and most efficient way to do that. Most of my projects I don't have the luxury of taking a 'shortcut' like that because they are too specific and unique to base off of a general template, but when I can utilize the work of a professional designer to save myself time and to build my design off of(probably resulting in an overall better look than I would've come up with on my own) for free - I think it's worth doing as long as their are no drawbacks(such as lower quality or increased cost). I do love creating things as a developer, and it's fun to use new technologies and experiment, but my main goal here specifically was just to create a quality website and get it online while I work on my <i>next</i> portfolio website project(details in the last paragraph) - and I think this was the most effective and efficient way to acheive that goal. I don't want to waste my time as a developer reinventing the wheel or repeating work that people more skilled/specialized in that area than I am have already done and are giving away for free. That being said, I ended up having/wanting to change so many things that my website barely resembles the template it was based off of anymore anyway, however I do think it still saved a decent amount of time and improved the quality of my final result though.

									Building this site was a good review in Bootstrap, HTML5/CSS3, and JQuery, and also gave me an opportunity to get used to working with a CSS precompiler like SASS a little more(I've used SASS on a couple projects before, but for some reason it took me a little bit to really appreciate it's value). I also always love an opportunity to create interactive UI elements with JQuery, which is soemthing I haven't had a chance to do in a while since I've been focusing more on React and other front end libraries. It was fun and refreshing to create a couple relatively simple JQuery components for this site, such as the image/video viewer in each of my project modals; you can see it in action to the right, although this project only has 2 items and they are both pictures so it's not exactly impressive, if you view my game project - "Merkle Brown" - you'll see a better example of it in action. The javascript for this component was actually extremely simple, but that's what I love about JQuery - once you know how to use it well you can create interesting interactive elements that really add to your site in a few minutes and a few lines of code - in this case I built the image/video viewer functionality with a single function consisting of about 8 lines of coder, and it works seemlessly for both videos(or any other iFrame embedded content) and images. The hard part in creating it was getting the layout and css styles to work inside of a modal, making everything fit wasn't <i>that</i> hard but - as you can see - I still haven't managed to make it look nice yet...

								<p class="project-text tldr">
									One of the main reasons I wanted to get this site up and running quickly was so that I could get my site online for now, while I worked on a bigger, long-term project to create its replacement: A portfolio web app/blog that I will be building while at the same time creating a tutorial/course that teaches developers how to build exactly what I'm building as I go. The goal of the course will be to teach users Node, Express, React, Redux, etc by having them follow along and create a real website that they can actually use. By the end, everyone who completes the course will have their own personal portfolio website and blog, both with easy-to-use admin panels where they can easily upload new blog posts or new portfolio projects by uploading images/videos and filling in a form to specify the project name, description, etc. I plan on having a few students follow along with the course as I create it, giving lessons in live-streams and helping them all out along the way, then at the end I can add recordings of the live-stream sessions and answers to any questions asked by students in the tutorial, which should help to make sure any common problems or difficult areas are thoroughly explained by the time the tutorial is put online for everyone to view. Students will be encouranged, and taught how, to customize the project in the tutorial to suite their needs so everyone doesn't end up with the same end-result as eachother(and me!). When I'm done, I will have my newly created portfolio/blog site to post the actual course on where users can view the tutorial on a website that is very similar to what they will actually be creating, which I think is pretty cool.

            	<p class="text-light">
            		My passion for creating things is what first drew me into programming. By age 10 I was already a computer nerd, but I had yet to discover the possibilities of programming until I came across a VB6 "Hello World" tutorial on a game modding forum. I immediately got to work installing VB and completing the tutorial and was amazed when my program actually worked. I was instantly hooked, before long I had way more ideas for software projects than I could ever realistically complete. That's when my passion for creating things and desire to learn more took over.
            	</p>
            	
            	<p class="text-light">
            		I made a lot of games early on, but it wasn't long before I started coming up with all sorts of ideas for different types of software: websites, tools, and eventually mobile apps. I went through a phase for pretty much every type of software development at one point, but eventually settled on Web Development(with game dev as a secondary side/hobby interest). I want to create software that is accessible, used by a lot of people, on a platform that doesn't limit the possibilities of what I can create; overall the web is the perfect choice for me. At this point I think I can say I'm a pretty capable and talented developer, I'm very well-rounded and have all the basics mastered as well as some of the more advanced topics. Luckily, my desire to create better, more complex software will always drive me to keep learning, meaning my skills won't stop improving any time soon.

            		As a full-stack developer, I'm most comfortable working with Node, Express, and MongoDB on the back end and React for front end development. I've also used Ruby on Rails and a little bit of Java for back end programming, and am very competent using JQuery or vanilla JS for front end development. I've used javascript extensively, in all of my web development projects as well as a few games I developed(including Merkle Brown - one of my current side projects), and consider myself an expert in javascript. I've learned about all the changes and new features of ES6 as well and have gotten very good at working with it.

            	<p class="text-light">
            		I'm also no stranger to HTML/CSS, two languages I've been using almost since I started programming around 2003. Nowadays, I'm very competent with HTML5/CSS3 and CSS preprocessors such as SASS. I know how to use HTML and CSS(or SASS) together to create responsive websites that work well on all browsers, regardless of screen size and how up-to-date the browsers support is for CSS. Combined with my advanced javascript and back end development experience, I can create anything from a basic static webpage for a small business to a complex SPA(single-page app) with all the latest features that communicates with a custom back end and/or 3rd part API's - all while maintaining great performance.
