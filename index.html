  	TODO:
  	
  	plans...
  		Turn the 'services' section into an interactive demo showing off pieces of different things I can do. e.g clips/screenshots of Merkle Brown, NuTrack, and portfolio page itself(webpage-inception/recursion):
  		- dark/black background, with a barely lit(gradient from dark-grey to black) floor section at the bottom extending up and to the middle(angled to look like a floor).
  		- full-screen(100vh)
  		- Across the top is a row with 3-4 blocks(web apps, static sites, games, get in touch). whichever one is selected slides to the end/right, 'rotating' the whole row(any blocks to the right will rotate off the side and come back on the left). ends of the row have a gradient from transparent-to-black, so that before a block slides off the end it looks like it's fading out as it moves further to the right, or fading in as it moves in from the left. Maybe mess around with squeezing/stretching the width as it goes off one of the ends too(if x > threshold then width = maxWidth * (x - threshhold) * modifier / 100)
  		- whichever item is current being displayed is shown below the row, taking up most of the screen. There is large text to the left going from top to bottom of screen, with a big picture/gif/video to the right taking up most of the right side of screen. Title is above the text on the left, not above the whole thing.
  		
  		
  		PORTFOLIO...
  		Also full-screen, but this time white/light colored:
  		
  				-!!!!!!!!!!Make it so that the portfolio section looks like a block/box, and the services section is an empty space/cube. The 'floor' part of the services section can be made to look like the top of the 'portfolio' section block.
  		
  		- 3x3 large squares for each project. Each square is an image, tinted a different color(red, purple, blue, pink, orange, yellow) with white text over it for the name and maybe some details/description. Hovering over the square gets rid of the tint, and makes the square grow a little bit(without effecting positioning of other blocks. for every px the width/height grows, decrease the margins of the square or the padding of it's container by the same amount)
  		
  		- when a square/project is clicked, all the project squares fade out, and then a full-screen div fades in from top to bottom(render the full-screen div and another full-screen white div covering it, the white div has a small gradient to transparent at the top. white div slides down and off the bottom or shrinks to 0 height, giving the appearance of the project-div fading in from top to bottom).
  		
  		- project details div(and the project section in general) should be very open and spacey. Is very white(with maybe some slight grey gradient in the middle), with big paddings/margins around all the text and images. Make it feel free and open and calm, instead of congested and cluttered and hectic.
  		
  		
  		
  		Create an image for skills section, listing all languages/tech in a tree-like structure. Put that in the right col and put a short bio on the left

						 	I am a full-stack web developer, meaning I can create a back end that connects to a database, manipulates data, and sends data to the frontend - and I can also do complex front end development, create complex UI's, make a web page adapt to different screen sizes and communicate with the back end to grab data and display it in a clear and appealing way. I've created many web applications from scratch and am experienced at creating complex web apps with clean, well-organized code.

            	As stated in the sectio to the left(or above if you're on a small screen), I consider myself a creator. Programming is just the tool that I use, and I personally thing I'm pretty darn good at using it, but I also bring a lot of other very useful skills to the table. I have experience with the full development cycle for websites/web apps, mobile apps, and games. This means that I can turn that web app idea you've been wanting to make into a quality website, I can ask you some questions about your business and use that information to create the perfect website to increase your sales, I can help turn your game concept into a full-fledged design and the program it for you, I can take a set of business requirements or specifications and write clean, robust, and error-free code that does exactly what it's supposed to. Right now I am searching for employment as a web or software developer and am also open to accepting freelance jobs, so <a href="#">contact me</a> if you need to hire a creator who happens to be good at writing code

            		<h5 class="project-subheader text-left">Overview</h5>
            		<p class="project-text">Merkle Brown is my current 'secondary' side-project, that I work on when I need a break from my main project. I plan on releasing it on several platforms as a commercial indie game when it's complete, using different wrappers to deploy it on Steam/Windows, Android, iOS, and of course I'll release it as a browser-based html5 game as well - it will even run in mobile web browsers without any downloads or plugins.</p>
            		
                    <h5 class="project-subheader text-left">Features</h5>
            		<p class="project-text">Merkle Brown is a 2D, physics-based platformer game with realtime physics simulation, custom hardware-accelerated shaders for lighting and other effects, tons of complicated dynamic and scripted game objects, and an extremely capable(albeit ugly) level editor that allows you to build dynamic obstacles by combining different bodies, triggers, effects, actions, movepaths, joints, springs, and more, allowing endless possibilities for different creative and fun game objects. It's also possible playtest levels as you create them inside the editor, allowing for quick iteration and testing - which is crucial when designing non-tile based levels for a platformer game and you need to position things just right in order to perfect the difficulty curve.</p>
                  
                  
                    <h5 class="project-subheader text-left">Progress</h5>
                    <p class="project-text">Although the engine itself is mostly complete and editor and other game code is pretty far along, none of the levels or graphics I have created at this point will end up in the final game. I've written all the tools I need to create an awesome and fun game, and now I just need to put it all together into a cohesive whole using quality assets and exceptional level & graphic design. My art skills were HORRIBLE when I started this project, and although they've come a very long way, I don't think I'm capable of doing the game justice with my art yet. I'm much better with level design, and have made some truly interesting and enjoyable levels already while building and testing the different features of my engine and editor, but I really want to focus on getting the level design absolutely perfect as I feel that is the single most crucial factor in making a quality platformer game, and I'm not quite there yet. I plan on continuing to do what I've done this far, which is to keep iterating on the graphics and level design as a add features and improve my engine and editor, pushing myself to learn more and improve a lot on each iteration, until I finally feel like I'm capable of creating a truly top-quality game that stands out in every category. I've come such a long way from when I first started, and this project has truly been an emotional journey, but I know if I keep improving as I have been and stay true to my vision I will end up with an amazing game that I can be extremely proud of</p>

            		<h5 class="project-subheader text-left">Overview</h5>
            		<p class="project-text">NuTrack is a Single-Page Web Application made with Node, MongoDB, Express, and React. It retrieves nutrient data on the backend from the USDA Nutrient Data API and serves it with it's own custom API that adds many more features. The purpose of the app is to provide a flexible and easy-to-use tool that users can use to plan their food/nutrient consumption and track their progress. When I first started the project my plan was to make something with the USDA API mostly just to practice and learn some new technologies, but before long I ended up finding my own uses for the App and coming up with tons of useful new features that I wanted to add, and the project soon become something much larger and more useful than I had originally planned. I use it mainly to make sure I am getting enough calories to keep my weight up but it also provides other insights about my nutrition patterns automatically and has made me more aware of how my eating habits are effecting my health.</p>
            		
            		<p class="project-text">NuTrack is basically in the "Minimum-Viable-Product" phase right now, it works as a cohesive application and has many useful features, but the more I work on it the bigger my vision for the project becomes - I now have a pretty long todo-list of tweaks and new features I want to implement, some of which will improve the usability and capabilities of the app drastically. Once I implement a few of the larger, more impactful features that I have planned, I intend to set up real hosting for the app and release to the public as a commercial web app with trial accounts available for free and premium accounts available for a small monthly subscription fee. Right now I don't think NuTrack is useful enough for many people to want to pay for it; the limits of the USDA Database(mainly the lack of many popular food products) as well the lack of a few key features I plan on implementing and the mediocre, quickly made design of the current site are the only things holding it back from being a high-quality, useful, commercial web application. Luckily, all of these things are fixable - the limitations of the USDA Database will be the most difficult, but I have a fun and interesting solution planned to fix that problem.</p>

            	<p class="text-light">
            		My passion for creating things is what first drew me into programming. By age 10 I was already a computer nerd, but I had yet to discover the possibilities of programming until I came across a VB6 "Hello World" tutorial on a game modding forum. I immediately got to work installing VB and completing the tutorial and was amazed when my program actually worked. I was instantly hooked, before long I had way more ideas for software projects than I could ever realistically complete. That's when my passion for creating things and desire to learn more took over.
            	</p>
            	
            	<p class="text-light">
            		I made a lot of games early on, but it wasn't long before I started coming up with all sorts of ideas for different types of software: websites, tools, and eventually mobile apps. I went through a phase for pretty much every type of software development at one point, but eventually settled on Web Development(with game dev as a secondary side/hobby interest). I want to create software that is accessible, used by a lot of people, on a platform that doesn't limit the possibilities of what I can create; overall the web is the perfect choice for me. At this point I think I can say I'm a pretty capable and talented developer, I'm very well-rounded and have all the basics mastered as well as some of the more advanced topics. Luckily, my desire to create better, more complex software will always drive me to keep learning, meaning my skills won't stop improving any time soon.

            		As a full-stack developer, I'm most comfortable working with Node, Express, and MongoDB on the back end and React for front end development. I've also used Ruby on Rails and a little bit of Java for back end programming, and am very competent using JQuery or vanilla JS for front end development. I've used javascript extensively, in all of my web development projects as well as a few games I developed(including Merkle Brown - one of my current side projects), and consider myself an expert in javascript. I've learned about all the changes and new features of ES6 as well and have gotten very good at working with it.
            	</p>
            	
            	<p class="text-light">
            		I'm also no stranger to HTML/CSS, two languages I've been using almost since I started programming around 2003. Nowadays, I'm very competent with HTML5/CSS3 and CSS preprocessors such as SASS. I know how to use HTML and CSS(or SASS) together to create responsive websites that work well on all browsers, regardless of screen size and how up-to-date the browsers support is for CSS. Combined with my advanced javascript and back end development experience, I can create anything from a basic static webpage for a small business to a complex SPA(single-page app) with all the latest features that communicates with a custom back end and/or 3rd part API's - all while maintaining great performance.
