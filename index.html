  	TODO:
  	
  	plans...
  		Turn the 'services' section into an interactive demo showing off pieces of different things I can do. e.g clips/screenshots of Merkle Brown, NuTrack, and portfolio page itself(webpage-inception/recursion):
  		- dark/black background, with a barely lit(gradient from dark-grey to black) floor section at the bottom extending up and to the middle(angled to look like a floor).
  		- full-screen(100vh)
  		- Across the top is a row with 3-4 blocks(web apps, static sites, games, get in touch). whichever one is selected slides to the end/right, 'rotating' the whole row(any blocks to the right will rotate off the side and come back on the left). ends of the row have a gradient from transparent-to-black, so that before a block slides off the end it looks like it's fading out as it moves further to the right, or fading in as it moves in from the left. Maybe mess around with squeezing/stretching the width as it goes off one of the ends too(if x > threshold then width = maxWidth * (x - threshhold) * modifier / 100)
  		- whichever item is current being displayed is shown below the row, taking up most of the screen. There is large text to the left going from top to bottom of screen, with a big picture/gif/video to the right taking up most of the right side of screen. Title is above the text on the left, not above the whole thing.
  		
  		
  		PORTFOLIO...
  		Also full-screen, but this time white/light colored:
  		
  				-!!!!!!!!!!Make it so that the portfolio section looks like a block/box, and the services section is an empty space/cube. The 'floor' part of the services section can be made to look like the top of the 'portfolio' section block.
  		
  		- 3x3 large squares for each project. Each square is an image, tinted a different color(red, purple, blue, pink, orange, yellow) with white text over it for the name and maybe some details/description. Hovering over the square gets rid of the tint, and makes the square grow a little bit(without effecting positioning of other blocks. for every px the width/height grows, decrease the margins of the square or the padding of it's container by the same amount)
  		
  		- when a square/project is clicked, all the project squares fade out, and then a full-screen div fades in from top to bottom(render the full-screen div and another full-screen white div covering it, the white div has a small gradient to transparent at the top. white div slides down and off the bottom or shrinks to 0 height, giving the appearance of the project-div fading in from top to bottom).
  		
  		- project details div(and the project section in general) should be very open and spacey. Is very white(with maybe some slight grey gradient in the middle), with big paddings/margins around all the text and images. Make it feel free and open and calm, instead of congested and cluttered and hectic.
  		
  		
  		
  		Create an image for skills section, listing all languages/tech in a tree-like structure. Put that in the right col and put a short bio on the left
  		
  		
  		Urgent To-Do's - before anyone looks at my portfolio:
  		PORTFOLIO:
  			- Do some algorithm writeups w/ solutions and post as a portfolio item to demonstrate competence/skill in algorithms/data-structures. Start with a Dijkstra or a difficult BFS/DFS, include some simple but tricky "riddle-y" problems, one or two DP problems, and anything else that is interesting or fun
  		NUTRACK:
  			- For each page that requires user to be logged in to user, add a "You must be logged in to access this page" warning, and below it give instructions such as "If you are viewing this site from my portfolio, log in(link in top nav bar) with username: nutrack password: nupass. Also create meals and fill up Tracker/Planner on the example account so users can easily view the web apps functionality

						 	I am a full-stack web developer, meaning I can create a back end that connects to a database, manipulates data, and sends data to the frontend - and I can also do complex front end development, create complex UI's, make a web page adapt to different screen sizes and communicate with the back end to grab data and display it in a clear and appealing way. I've created many web applications from scratch and am experienced at creating complex web apps with clean, well-organized code.

That includes anything from real-time data visualization to a complete, fully-featured game that you can play on a website without downloading anything(even on mobile phones!).

            	As stated in the sectio to the left(or above if you're on a small screen), I consider myself a creator. Programming is just the tool that I use, and I personally thing I'm pretty darn good at using it, but I also bring a lot of other very useful skills to the table. I have experience with the full development cycle for websites/web apps, mobile apps, and games. This means that I can turn that web app idea you've been wanting to make into a quality website, I can ask you some questions about your business and use that information to create the perfect website to increase your sales, I can help turn your game concept into a full-fledged design and the program it for you, I can take a set of business requirements or specifications and write clean, robust, and error-free code that does exactly what it's supposed to.

                <p class="text-center light-text">Read my <a href="#">Blog</a> to learn more about what I do</p>
            	<p class="text-light">
            		My passion for creating things is what first drew me into programming. By age 10 I was already a computer nerd, but I had yet to discover the possibilities of programming until I came across a VB6 "Hello World" tutorial on a game modding forum. I immediately got to work installing VB and completing the tutorial and was amazed when my program actually worked. I was instantly hooked, before long I had way more ideas for software projects than I could ever realistically complete. That's when my passion for creating things and desire to learn more took over.
            	</p>
            	
            	<p class="text-light">
            		I made a lot of games early on, but it wasn't long before I started coming up with all sorts of ideas for different types of software: websites, tools, and eventually mobile apps. I went through a phase for pretty much every type of software development at one point, but eventually settled on Web Development(with game dev as a secondary side/hobby interest). I want to create software that is accessible, used by a lot of people, on a platform that doesn't limit the possibilities of what I can create; overall the web is the perfect choice for me. At this point I think I can say I'm a pretty capable and talented developer, I'm very well-rounded and have all the basics mastered as well as some of the more advanced topics. Luckily, my desire to create better, more complex software will always drive me to keep learning, meaning my skills won't stop improving any time soon.

            		As a full-stack developer, I'm most comfortable working with Node, Express, and MongoDB on the back end and React for front end development. I've also used Ruby on Rails and a little bit of Java for back end programming, and am very competent using JQuery or vanilla JS for front end development. I've used javascript extensively, in all of my web development projects as well as a few games I developed(including Merkle Brown - one of my current side projects), and consider myself an expert in javascript. I've learned about all the changes and new features of ES6 as well and have gotten very good at working with it.

            		I'm also no stranger to HTML/CSS, two languages I've been using almost since I started programming around 2003. Nowadays, I'm very competent with HTML5/CSS3 and CSS preprocessors such as SASS. I know how to use HTML and CSS(or SASS) together to create responsive websites that work well on all browsers, regardless of screen size and how up-to-date the browsers support is for CSS. Combined with my advanced javascript and back end development experience, I can create anything from a basic static webpage for a small business to a complex SPA(single-page app) with all the latest features that communicates with a custom back end and/or 3rd part API's - all while maintaining great performance.
