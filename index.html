						 I love creating things; Programming is just the tool that I use to create - one that I think I've gotten pretty decent at using - but I also bring a lot of other very useful skills to the table.

        			I tried to keep this short, but have evidently failed. I urge you to at least skim through it anyway - it's not so long as it looks!<br /> <br /></b>I'm basically just a normal guy, I love learning new things, creating things, and programming. I'm pretty good at problem-solving, pretty bad at art(but getting better - I'm practicing art so I can design and create better software), great at communicating and getting along or working with others. Right now my main goal, aside from completing my current software projects, is to join a team and work as a professional developer. I want to interact with other developers, learn from them, and make something awesome as part of a team; I have been preparing for such an opportunity and am pretty confident that I could be a very valuable and productive member of a development team. Here's a few thoughts about my experience with programming and software development:
        			
        			<span class='about-me-bullet'>I first got into programming because I loved technology and games, and I thought coding was 'cool'(or maybe I thought it was 'Da Bomb,' I don't really remember and this was in the 90s so it's very possible)
							</span>
							
         			<span class='about-me-bullet'>I kept writing code because I was good at it; logic and problem solving were/are my strengths and, being the show-offy youngster I was, I loved doing stuff I was good at
							</span>
							
         			<span class='about-me-bullet'>programming is still my passion because I still love technology and games, I'm still good at logic and problem solving(but fortunately not such a showoff anymore; life has certainly humbled me), and because as an adult I found that I love creating things and that's what I want to do with my life  - programming is an extremely creative tool with infinite possibilities for creation, it's awesome
							</span>
							
         			<span class='about-me-bullet'>My desire to create things lead me to broaden and improve my programming skills. I wanted to create mobile apps, games, websites, AI algorithms, etc, so I learned how to. experiencing many different types of software development helped me understand how to create better software and write better code in general
							</span>
							
         			<span class='about-me-bullet'>My journey in software dev has lead me to develop many other adjacent skills. I got <span class="strike">good</span> better at visual art by creating graphics for games and designing websites, I learned how to think about and apply principles of UI and UX design so I could make better websites and apps, and I learned how to engineer fun in my many attempts at game design(a skill which I am currently applying in a different way - in order to improve the user experience in my current web app project and motivate users to use my app to improve their eating and nutrition habits)
							</span>
         	
         			<span class='about-me-bullet'>This journey(plus a lot of hard work) has lead me to become a skilled creator of websites, apps, and games. I know how to write good code, but I also know how to design a good user experience, create aesthetics that compliment the software's functionality, and communicate with others to work together and convert an idea into quality software</span>

            		<span class='about-me-bullet'>
            		<strong>For basic frontend web development,</strong> I can use any combination of html or html5 + CSS or CSS3 + vanilla JS or JQuery. I'm also pretty good with React, SASS, Bootstrap and a ton of lesser-known and more specific js libraries(a ton meaning like > 0.0012% of them in this case). I've also used Angular, but am not an expert and haven't used it in a while(meaning I could easily get up and running with it very quickly and be very effective/productive in angular). There are probably a ton of other smaller technologies I'm forgetting or that are too small to mention

            	<span class='about-me-bullet'>
            		<strong>My go-to backend tech</strong> these days is Node.js. I like to work with Node, MongoDB, and Express for most projects, unless it's not a good fit for the project for whatever reason. Like any other Node developer, I'll also throw in a bunch of other packages depending on the specific needs of my project(body-parser, passport, morgan, etc). I also have experience with Ruby on Rails(versions 3 and 4, though I want to try out Rails 5 and specifically Action-Cable soon). I've technically used DJango before too, but it was long ago and I wouldn't be able to pick it up again and use it without spending the first few days googling how to do everything until I got used to it again

            		<strong>My mobile experience</strong> is mostly limited to Android Development, and although it was a few years ago I still remember the general principles and would only need to refresh myself real quick on the android API and some other specifics in order to be competent at Android dev again. I used Java and the Android SDK to create native Android apps, as well as libGDX, openGL, or AndEngine to create native android games.

								<strong>Game dev</strong>... I've been making games in one way or another for a decade, on many different platforms. The concepts, and sometimes even the libraries(e.g openGL, libGDX), are the same on any platform. I understand the nuances of using an entity-component-system vs a hierarchical OOP structure to organize game objects, how to optimize the game loop, writing pathfinding algorithms and designing steering behaviors to program game-ai, and all that other advanced sounding stuff. I feel very comfortable working on game projects, I can implement any reasonably-sized game design and meet any reasonable performance or time requirements.

           		<span class="about-me-bullet">I also particularly enjoy solving complex problems with <strong>algorithms and data-structures</strong>. This is a skill that's applicable in every single type of development, and helps improve your over all problem solving abilities. I am far from the best, but I occassionally compete in algorithms competitions on sites like topcoder.com, and am good at solving complex coding problems using advanced data-structores and techniques such as Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Geometry/trig, depth- and breadth- first-search and all the algorithms derived from them, and many more</span>
