  	TODO:
  	
  	plans...
  		Turn the 'services' section into an interactive demo showing off pieces of different things I can do. e.g clips/screenshots of Merkle Brown, NuTrack, and portfolio page itself(webpage-inception/recursion):
  		- dark/black background, with a barely lit(gradient from dark-grey to black) floor section at the bottom extending up and to the middle(angled to look like a floor).
  		- full-screen(100vh)
  		- Across the top is a row with 3-4 blocks(web apps, static sites, games, get in touch). whichever one is selected slides to the end/right, 'rotating' the whole row(any blocks to the right will rotate off the side and come back on the left). ends of the row have a gradient from transparent-to-black, so that before a block slides off the end it looks like it's fading out as it moves further to the right, or fading in as it moves in from the left. Maybe mess around with squeezing/stretching the width as it goes off one of the ends too(if x > threshold then width = maxWidth * (x - threshhold) * modifier / 100)
  		- whichever item is current being displayed is shown below the row, taking up most of the screen. There is large text to the left going from top to bottom of screen, with a big picture/gif/video to the right taking up most of the right side of screen. Title is above the text on the left, not above the whole thing.
  		
  		
  		PORTFOLIO...
  		Also full-screen, but this time white/light colored:
  		
  				-!!!!!!!!!!Make it so that the portfolio section looks like a block/box, and the services section is an empty space/cube. The 'floor' part of the services section can be made to look like the top of the 'portfolio' section block.
  		
  		- 3x3 large squares for each project. Each square is an image, tinted a different color(red, purple, blue, pink, orange, yellow) with white text over it for the name and maybe some details/description. Hovering over the square gets rid of the tint, and makes the square grow a little bit(without effecting positioning of other blocks. for every px the width/height grows, decrease the margins of the square or the padding of it's container by the same amount)
  		
  		- when a square/project is clicked, all the project squares fade out, and then a full-screen div fades in from top to bottom(render the full-screen div and another full-screen white div covering it, the white div has a small gradient to transparent at the top. white div slides down and off the bottom or shrinks to 0 height, giving the appearance of the project-div fading in from top to bottom).
  		
  		- project details div(and the project section in general) should be very open and spacey. Is very white(with maybe some slight grey gradient in the middle), with big paddings/margins around all the text and images. Make it feel free and open and calm, instead of congested and cluttered and hectic.
  		
  		
  		
  		Create an image for skills section, listing all languages/tech in a tree-like structure. Put that in the right col and put a short bio on the left
  		
  		
  		Urgent To-Do's - before anyone looks at my portfolio:
  		PORTFOLIO:
  			- Do some algorithm writeups w/ solutions and post as a portfolio item to demonstrate competence/skill in algorithms/data-structures. Start with a Dijkstra or a difficult BFS/DFS, include some simple but tricky "riddle-y" problems, one or two DP problems, and anything else that is interesting or fun
  		NUTRACK:
  			- For each page that requires user to be logged in to user, add a "You must be logged in to access this page" warning, and below it give instructions such as "If you are viewing this site from my portfolio, log in(link in top nav bar) with username: nutrack password: nupass. Also create meals and fill up Tracker/Planner on the example account so users can easily view the web apps functionality

        <p class="project-text tldr">
            Let's Play is an Android app I created for a freelance client. My client had written a book about different card, dice, domino, and dart games containing rules, how to play, histories of the games, and other information, and he wanted an App to sell along with the book. He gave me the content of the book, formatted in html and css, and asked me to create an Android that displayed the books content organized inside of an easy-to-use UI and also contained a dynamic scoreboard that would work for any combination of game-type, number of players, and number of rounds. 
        </p>
        <p class="project-text tldr">
            The project actually consisted of several apps, mainly the '100 Games' version, but also separate versions for just cards, darts, dominos, or dice games. All of the apps were very similar to each other though and creating the different versions didn't add any new technical challenges to the project. In the section below you'll find links to the main '100 Games' app as well as the '25 Card Games' app on the app store.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text tldr">
            Instead of tediously copying every single page of the books content into Android Activities and layouts, I just created the basic UI flow and menu's and used a modified version of Android's WebView component to load the pages he gave me. The default WebView implementation took a second to load after the screen for that section of the book loaded, so I modified the code to pre-load the content for the pages to be displayed based on the users location in the menu so that when the user clicked on a game, the preloaded WebView could be displayed instantly. The preloading didn't have any noticeable performance side-effects and worked well across all Android devices tested.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text tldr">
            The project was completed successfully ahead of time, and I uploaded the App to the <a href="">App Store</a> for my client. He was very happy with the results and left me the following review on Elance.com:
