  	TODO:
  	
  	plans...
  		Turn the 'services' section into an interactive demo showing off pieces of different things I can do. e.g clips/screenshots of Merkle Brown, NuTrack, and portfolio page itself(webpage-inception/recursion):
  		- dark/black background, with a barely lit(gradient from dark-grey to black) floor section at the bottom extending up and to the middle(angled to look like a floor).
  		- full-screen(100vh)
  		- Across the top is a row with 3-4 blocks(web apps, static sites, games, get in touch). whichever one is selected slides to the end/right, 'rotating' the whole row(any blocks to the right will rotate off the side and come back on the left). ends of the row have a gradient from transparent-to-black, so that before a block slides off the end it looks like it's fading out as it moves further to the right, or fading in as it moves in from the left. Maybe mess around with squeezing/stretching the width as it goes off one of the ends too(if x > threshold then width = maxWidth * (x - threshhold) * modifier / 100)
  		- whichever item is current being displayed is shown below the row, taking up most of the screen. There is large text to the left going from top to bottom of screen, with a big picture/gif/video to the right taking up most of the right side of screen. Title is above the text on the left, not above the whole thing.
  		
  		
  		PORTFOLIO...
  		Also full-screen, but this time white/light colored:
  		
  				-!!!!!!!!!!Make it so that the portfolio section looks like a block/box, and the services section is an empty space/cube. The 'floor' part of the services section can be made to look like the top of the 'portfolio' section block.
  		
  		- 3x3 large squares for each project. Each square is an image, tinted a different color(red, purple, blue, pink, orange, yellow) with white text over it for the name and maybe some details/description. Hovering over the square gets rid of the tint, and makes the square grow a little bit(without effecting positioning of other blocks. for every px the width/height grows, decrease the margins of the square or the padding of it's container by the same amount)
  		
  		- when a square/project is clicked, all the project squares fade out, and then a full-screen div fades in from top to bottom(render the full-screen div and another full-screen white div covering it, the white div has a small gradient to transparent at the top. white div slides down and off the bottom or shrinks to 0 height, giving the appearance of the project-div fading in from top to bottom).
  		
  		- project details div(and the project section in general) should be very open and spacey. Is very white(with maybe some slight grey gradient in the middle), with big paddings/margins around all the text and images. Make it feel free and open and calm, instead of congested and cluttered and hectic.
  		
  		
  		
  		Create an image for skills section, listing all languages/tech in a tree-like structure. Put that in the right col and put a short bio on the left
  		
  		
  		Urgent To-Do's - before anyone looks at my portfolio:
  		PORTFOLIO:
  			- Do some algorithm writeups w/ solutions and post as a portfolio item to demonstrate competence/skill in algorithms/data-structures. Start with a Dijkstra or a difficult BFS/DFS, include some simple but tricky "riddle-y" problems, one or two DP problems, and anything else that is interesting or fun
  		NUTRACK:
  			- For each page that requires user to be logged in to user, add a "You must be logged in to access this page" warning, and below it give instructions such as "If you are viewing this site from my portfolio, log in(link in top nav bar) with username: nutrack password: nupass. Also create meals and fill up Tracker/Planner on the example account so users can easily view the web apps functionality

        <p class="project-text tldr">
            Libra was one of my first real freelance projects. The client was an educator who already had a game app that they designed created by another freelancer. The app that they had was made with OpenGL, but didn't function reliably and was missing some key features they wanted, so they decided to find another developer to remake the game in AndEngine and fix the parts that were lacking in their previous app. AndEngine was a popular 2d Android game engine at the time that worked well with Box2D. 
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
            This game was designed to teach fractions to young students. It consists of a balance scale and a bunch of small weights with a fraction drawn on them to denote how much they weight. At the beginning of a round, one side of the balance would have 1 or more weights on it and the other side would be empty. The player has a selection of different weights at the bottom of the screen and their goal is to drag and drop them on to the empty side of the scale to even out the weight. The game uses Box2D for real-time physics simulation, so the balance will tilt towards whichever side has more weight and even out as the user adds weights to the other side and gets closer to balancing the scale. The realistic physics and smooth feel helped students get an intuitive understanding of how fractions work and how the fractional weights relate to one another, I think the game really would help students comprehension of fractions.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
            The original version of the app was created with openGL, and didn't have real physics simulation but instead was just programmed to either tilt the scale left or right depending which side had more weight until the user evened out both sides. In addition to providing the inuitive understanding of fractions, adding the physics also made the app function much more smoothly - e.g. instead of draging a weight to one side of the scale or the other and having it 'snap' into position on one of the scale plates, users could now drag it around the drop it and let it fall due to gravity and either land on the scale or fall to the ground, and users had to physically drop the weights on to the scale for it to work. If the user dropped the weight from a high height onto the scale it would make the scale quickly tip in the direction of the dropped weight before oscilating back and forth a few times and then balancing out - just as you'd expect the balance to behave in real life. The realistic feel made the game much more fun to play with in my opinion and probably helped engage students much more than the previous version of the app.

            When I took the job I had almost no Android development experience, but it was a porting job from OpenGL to AndEngine, and I already knew a very small amount of OpenGL and had heard that AndEngine was easy to use and learn, so I decided to write a proposal for the job and hope the client hired me anyway. To my surprise I got hired and only had a couple weeks to complete the project - which in hindsight is a pretty long time for an App like this, but since I had to learn Android development and AndEngine first it was kind of a tight deadline for me. I finished the project with only a couple days to spare, and managed to fix all the bugs and missing features in the OpenGL version of the game(mostly just a bug to do with scoring and a problem with the touch & drag functionality not working sometimes) as well as add the realistic physics in and make the gameplay much smoother, which the client was very happy with. I received a 5-star review on Elance from the client with the following testimonial:
