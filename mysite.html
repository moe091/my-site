  	TODO:
  	
  	plans...
  		Turn the 'services' section into an interactive demo showing off pieces of different things I can do. e.g clips/screenshots of Merkle Brown, NuTrack, and portfolio page itself(webpage-inception/recursion):
  		- dark/black background, with a barely lit(gradient from dark-grey to black) floor section at the bottom extending up and to the middle(angled to look like a floor).
  		- full-screen(100vh)
  		- Across the top is a row with 3-4 blocks(web apps, static sites, games, get in touch). whichever one is selected slides to the end/right, 'rotating' the whole row(any blocks to the right will rotate off the side and come back on the left). ends of the row have a gradient from transparent-to-black, so that before a block slides off the end it looks like it's fading out as it moves further to the right, or fading in as it moves in from the left. Maybe mess around with squeezing/stretching the width as it goes off one of the ends too(if x > threshold then width = maxWidth * (x - threshhold) * modifier / 100)
  		- whichever item is current being displayed is shown below the row, taking up most of the screen. There is large text to the left going from top to bottom of screen, with a big picture/gif/video to the right taking up most of the right side of screen. Title is above the text on the left, not above the whole thing.
  		
  		
  		PORTFOLIO...
  		Also full-screen, but this time white/light colored:
  		
  				-!!!!!!!!!!Make it so that the portfolio section looks like a block/box, and the services section is an empty space/cube. The 'floor' part of the services section can be made to look like the top of the 'portfolio' section block.
  		
  		- 3x3 large squares for each project. Each square is an image, tinted a different color(red, purple, blue, pink, orange, yellow) with white text over it for the name and maybe some details/description. Hovering over the square gets rid of the tint, and makes the square grow a little bit(without effecting positioning of other blocks. for every px the width/height grows, decrease the margins of the square or the padding of it's container by the same amount)
  		
  		- when a square/project is clicked, all the project squares fade out, and then a full-screen div fades in from top to bottom(render the full-screen div and another full-screen white div covering it, the white div has a small gradient to transparent at the top. white div slides down and off the bottom or shrinks to 0 height, giving the appearance of the project-div fading in from top to bottom).
  		
  		- project details div(and the project section in general) should be very open and spacey. Is very white(with maybe some slight grey gradient in the middle), with big paddings/margins around all the text and images. Make it feel free and open and calm, instead of congested and cluttered and hectic.
  		
  		
  		
  		Create an image for skills section, listing all languages/tech in a tree-like structure. Put that in the right col and put a short bio on the left
  		
  		
  		Urgent To-Do's - before anyone looks at my portfolio:
  		PORTFOLIO:
  			- Do some algorithm writeups w/ solutions and post as a portfolio item to demonstrate competence/skill in algorithms/data-structures. Start with a Dijkstra or a difficult BFS/DFS, include some simple but tricky "riddle-y" problems, one or two DP problems, and anything else that is interesting or fun
  		NUTRACK:
  			- For each page that requires user to be logged in to user, add a "You must be logged in to access this page" warning, and below it give instructions such as "If you are viewing this site from my portfolio, log in(link in top nav bar) with username: nutrack password: nupass. Also create meals and fill up Tracker/Planner on the example account so users can easily view the web apps functionality

									<strong>Tech: </strong><br />

								<p class="project-text tldr">
									This is just my personal site, which I suppose you already know about if you are reading this. I thought I'd share a little bit about designing and developing this site and my future plans for it though as it's probably one of my nicest-looking static websites I've created to date.
								</p>
								
								<p class="project-text tldr">
									I based the design of this site off of one of the Bootstrap examples but heavily modified it for my own needs. I wanted something simple and clean that presented the information I needed to share in a clear way, and I think this was the best and most efficient way to do that. Most of my projects I don't have the luxury of taking a 'shortcut' like that because they are too specific and unique to base off of a general template, but when I can utilize the work of a professional designer to save myself time and to build my design off of(probably resulting in an overall better look than I would've come up with on my own) for free - I think it's worth doing as long as their are no drawbacks(such as lower quality or increased cost). I do love creating things as a developer, and it's fun to use new technologies and experiment, but my main goal here specifically was just to create a quality website and get it online while I work on my <i>next</i> portfolio website project(details in the last paragraph) - and I think this was the most effective and efficient way to acheive that goal. I don't want to waste my time as a developer reinventing the wheel or repeating work that people more skilled/specialized in that area than I am have already done and are giving away for free. That being said, I ended up having/wanting to change so many things that my website barely resembles the template it was based off of anymore anyway, however I do think it still saved a decent amount of time and improved the quality of my final result though.

									Building this site was a good review in Bootstrap, HTML5/CSS3, and JQuery, and also gave me an opportunity to get used to working with a CSS precompiler like SASS a little more(I've used SASS on a couple projects before, but for some reason it took me a little bit to really appreciate it's value). I also always love an opportunity to create interactive UI elements with JQuery, which is soemthing I haven't had a chance to do in a while since I've been focusing more on React and other front end libraries. It was fun and refreshing to create a couple relatively simple JQuery components for this site, such as the image/video viewer in each of my project modals; you can see it in action to the right, although this project only has 2 items and they are both pictures so it's not exactly impressive, if you view my game project - "Merkle Brown" - you'll see a better example of it in action. The javascript for this component was actually extremely simple, but that's what I love about JQuery - once you know how to use it well you can create interesting interactive elements that really add to your site in a few minutes and a few lines of code - in this case I built the image/video viewer functionality with a single function consisting of about 8 lines of coder, and it works seemlessly for both videos(or any other iFrame embedded content) and images. The hard part in creating it was getting the layout and css styles to work inside of a modal, making everything fit wasn't <i>that</i> hard but - as you can see - I still haven't managed to make it look nice yet...

									One of the main reasons I wanted to get this site up and running quickly was so that I could get my site online for now, while I worked on a bigger, long-term project to create its replacement: A portfolio web app/blog that I will be building while at the same time creating a tutorial/course that teaches developers how to build exactly what I'm building as I go. The goal of the course will be to teach users Node, Express, React, Redux, etc by having them follow along and create a real website that they can actually use. By the end, everyone who completes the course will have their own personal portfolio website and blog, both with easy-to-use admin panels where they can easily upload new blog posts or new portfolio projects by uploading images/videos and filling in a form to specify the project name, description, etc. I plan on having a few students follow along with the course as I create it, giving lessons in live-streams and helping them all out along the way, then at the end I can add recordings of the live-stream sessions and answers to any questions asked by students in the tutorial, which should help to make sure any common problems or difficult areas are thoroughly explained by the time the tutorial is put online for everyone to view. Students will be encouranged, and taught how, to customize the project in the tutorial to suite their needs so everyone doesn't end up with the same end-result as eachother(and me!). When I'm done, I will have my newly created portfolio/blog site to post the actual course on where users can view the tutorial on a website that is very similar to what they will actually be creating, which I think is pretty cool.
